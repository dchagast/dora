# A New Blockchain Compute Model: A Dev-Friendly Model for High Performance and Scalable Interoperability

In Web3's fast-evolving landscape, developers are demanding performance, affordability, flexibility, and seamless liquidity. As blockchain applications diversify—from DeFi to on-chain payments—the need for robust, high-performance infrastructure continues to grow. While existing developer tools and virtual machines (VMs) have paved the way, they remain limited in scope and struggle to meet the demands of high-frequency, data-intensive use cases.

To address these growing demands, we're reimagining blockchain computing for a new stage. Our model introduces a computing approach built for extreme performance, multi-language toolchains, seamless interoperability, and native integration with specialized co-processors, such as zkVMs and GPUs. This isn't merely a blockchain for decentralized apps—it's a foundation for the broad, complex demands of the modern decentralized internet.

## Performance and Cost Efficiency

The EVM, while functional, falls short on high-performance, low-latency tasks—two critical requirements for real-world adoption. Real-time payments, high-frequency decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and on-chain games, for example, require sub-second response times and transaction throughput capable of supporting massive user bases, far beyond the EVM's current capabilities. Over the past decade, even “glue” languages like Python and JavaScript have achieved performance improvements of up to 100x, fueled by advancements in programming languages, compilers, runtime technologies, and robust tooling ecosystems that shield developers from underlying complexities. This evolution in Web2 languages underscores the potential of adaptable infrastructure to meet high-performance demands.

Our compute model streamlines execution to achieve C-level performance through optimized compiler architecture and tailored enhancements for both CPU-bound and I/O-bound tasks. This allows complex logic to run natively on-chain without incurring performance or cost penalties. The result is an optimized layer that enables decentralized applications (dApps) to operate more efficiently and at lower costs, making high-frequency trading, real-time interactions, and data-intensive AI tasks feasible on-chain. This marks a significant step toward a blockchain ecosystem capable of managing complex, high-speed computations directly on-chain.

More than just speed, this approach enables the complexities of specific domains to gradually shift to specialized library developers, opening new doors for contract development across various fields. This shift empowers domain experts to define these complexities within libraries rather than embedding and locking them into the platform itself, fostering a more adaptable and specialized development environment.

## Standardization and Portability

Standardization is a critical step forward. Solana, for instance, uses a highly customized eBPF to enable efficient, secure execution of custom programs near the kernel, supporting high-performance, isolated operations that can safely interact with system-level events. However, the lack of universal standards introduces compatibility challenges and limits portability. By integrating standardized specifications, such as the EVM and WASM, directly into the compute model, we simplify porting, deployment, and collaboration, reducing barriers for developers and fostering ecosystem cohesion.

Standardization goes beyond usability; it's essential for enabling developers from diverse programming communities to collaborate on development and deployment, supporting contract execution across various platforms. Additionally, a standardized environment strengthens auditability and trust—two foundational pillars for a secure blockchain ecosystem.

## Developer-Centric Tooling and Language Diversity

For this vision to succeed, developers must feel empowered by a robust and intuitive interface. In Web3, the smart contract programming interface is the primary development interface through which they access platform capabilities, a contrast to Web2, where developers often interact directly with programming interfaces, databases, and other essential components.

Our model provides a comprehensive suite of tools, SDKs, and support for a wide range of programming languages. Web3 should be open and accessible—not exclusive—creating an environment where developers of any language or experience level can seamlessly build, test, and deploy their ideas. This model supports every stage of the development lifecycle, from tooling and debugging to deployment, fostering a cross-functional environment that welcomes diverse developer groups without confining them to a single language or toolkit. By embracing multi-language support, we prevent the fragmentation often seen when developers are restricted to specific languages, building a truly diverse and inclusive ecosystem.

## Seamless Liquidity with Native Interoperability

In a multi-chain ecosystem, liquidity and seamless interoperability are essential. Developers should be able to write contracts in one language and easily call them from another without added complexity. Our model enables multi-language smart contract development with native, frictionless cross-contract interoperability, reducing costs by eliminating the need for redundant VMs, inter-process communication overhead, and nested VM execution. This approach benefits not only developers but also lightens the computational load on blockchain infrastructure.

Additionally, our compute model supports dynamic, multi-dimensional interaction models—from one-to-one to many-to-one—spanning intra-process, inter-process, and cross-chain interoperability. This flexibility allows developers to structure interoperability according to their application's unique needs rather than adapting to constraints imposed by the compute layer.

## Collaboration with Heterogeneous Systems and Co-Processors

One of the most exciting aspects of this model is its compatibility with diverse compute units and external co-processors. Imagine a blockchain VM that can natively interact with external accelerators, such as SIMD for parallel computing, GPUs for high-intensity AI tasks or zkVMs for zero-knowledge proofs. This extensibility aligns perfectly with modern compute demands, making the blockchain platform as adaptable as any in the Web2 landscape.

By enabling co-processor compatibility, developers can now create blockchain solutions that were previously unimaginable. On-chain AI inference and zero-knowledge proofs become feasible while preserving blockchain's core security and transparency. This marks a significant step forward in expanding on-chain capabilities available to developers. Application developers can access co-processor capabilities seamlessly, as intuitively as writing standard code—this is where the magic of the new compute model truly shines.

This shift will also attract specialized talent to upstream library development, where domain experts can leverage performance-enhancing tools like ZKP and GPUs, unlocking their full potential for blockchain innovation and freeing these capabilities from being confined within the platform itself.

## Security and Privacy

Our model simplifies security management across various smart contracts through a unified, automated security auditing and formal verification tool. Additionally, by integrating ZKP and advanced encryption technologies, it protects user privacy while ensuring transaction authenticity. This suite of technologies not only strengthens the security of blockchain applications but also enhances the overall trustworthiness and sustainability of the ecosystem.

## Real-World Applications: A Platform for Limitless Possibilities

The transformative potential of this model is vast. Imagine global micropayments processed without prohibitive transaction fees or on-chain games with real-time data and seamless interactions. With co-processor integration, AI models could run directly on-chain, enabling real-time inference for applications ranging from fraud detection to personalized content recommendations. Cross-chain protocols would also gain, benefiting from increased reliability and reduced complexity, as this VM supports a broad array of network standards and data structures.

## A Vision for Blockchain Compute

Looking to the future, the path of our compute model is as varied as the possibilities within Web3. Should we focus on specialization or broader generalization? Aim for EVM compatibility or adopt a more generalized, high-performance approach similar to Solana's? Do we prioritize Python's accessibility or lean into Rust's system performance? These questions guide us in creating a compute environment that not only meets blockchain's current demands but also adapts to the rapid pace of technological and developer evolution. With advancements in compiler technology, we also consider when the time is right to transition fully to a compiled VM model.

Our compute model embodies a vision of unmatched performance, widely adopted standards, developer flexibility, and seamless interoperability. By pushing beyond current limitations and anticipating Web3's future needs, we're establishing a foundational compute layer poised to drive the next era of blockchain innovation.
